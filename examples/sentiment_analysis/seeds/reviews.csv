1,"Don't buy!: First of all, the company took my money and sent me an email telling me the product was shipped. A week and a half later I received another email telling me that they are sorry, but they don't actually have any of these items, and if I received an email telling me it has shipped, it was a mistake.When I finally got my money back, I went through another company to buy the product and it won't work with my phone, even though it depicts that it will. I have sent numerous emails to the company - I can't actually find a phone number on their website - and I still have not gotten any kind of response. What kind of customer service is that? No one will help me with this problem. My advice - don't waste your money!"
2,"Long and boring: I've read this book with much expectation, it was very boring all through out the book"
3,"Has No Range: I suppose if you were going to sit in the same room and have line-of-sight with the device, lamp, etc. plugged into this control, it might work. Maybe. But I had it completely within the stated range and one basic house wall separating me and the unit, and it was completely unreliable.I'd recommend spending a touch more money and getting a higher quality product."
4,"Three Days of Use and It Broke: Very disappointed in this product. It worked perfectly for exactly three days and could not be resuscitated. It was very inexpensive so I did not want to pay half again the price to ship it back for an exchange, so the company would do nothing when they sent me an inquiry as to product satisfaction."
5,"Doublecharged for shipping because merchant was backordered: Merchant was out of stock on the second pair of pants, so when it was shipped I was charged $9 again when the second pair was in stock weeks later.Will not buy from Amazon vendors again."
6,"Okay but Messy....: We purchased this bag for a vacation we were taking a cruise and we wanted to use it when we left the ship. The bag was convenient to carry, however the faux leather began peeling. At first it wasn't so bad but then it became annoying because it then began flaking all over your skin and clothes. I would have rather the bag been a cloth bag with no flaking than the faux leather that I had to keep wisking away from my skin and clothes."
7,"Deep view of what counts for run and growing an organization: I will say that the concept this book adds of ""playing with future"" is the utmost importance for many of us who were tough by experience to survive and keep it running. The most important thing about work is to get it done...if not...it equals all us..we all lose That does not help a lot any organization. This books deals about how to get it done self sustained and fruitfull"
8,"Climalite works as intended: More visually interesting than plain white, and the material is definitely better for dampness than plain cotton. But please don't wear them with sandals, they aren't that visually interesting!The bottom black part is thicker, but not thick enough to pill or get natty with use...you know what I mean...thick socks have a way of breaking down with wear.The uppers, the white and colored part are thin, stretchy and breathable, flexible enough as well to pull down slightly in the rear to make them no-shows if you choose."
9,"Best witch book i've ever read!!!: Spellbinder was the 1st Night World book I have ever read.I recomended this book to ALL my friends,and I recomend it to you also. L.J. Smith is a very talented writer and I plan to read ALL of her books to come."
10,"Great Work, Poorly Organized Kindle Book: This review is intended as a review of the book, not of the work of Edgar Allan Poe. As a Poe fan, I purchased this book just for the pure fun of reading Poe on my Kindle. However, the book is so poorly organized that finding a particular tale or poem is a real pain and takes a lot of the fun out of it. While there is a table of contents, the individual works are not list there; rather there are groupings of the works so you have to know (or guess) to which group the work you may be looking for belongs. Alas, there is also no index. This is an electronic book: I should be able to toggle down a table of contents to a particular work, select it, and be taken there, but it doesn't happen that way. Not recommended for Kindle readers!"
11,"What a disappointment!: I am a big Belva Plain fan and have always enjoyed her books. After the Fire is a disappointing read. What bothered me the most is the character of Hyacinth-what a weak and stupid woman! She is not believable at all. Any mother will fight to the end for her children. I kept hoping she would snap out of it, but she never did. She just kept trusting stupid men and believing them. I will think twice before spending money on another Belva Plain novel in the future."
12,"Glorify Thy Name w/ Kent Henry: Great! This is a Kent Henry praise and worship classic - you can not go wrong with this one. Do not sleep on Kent Henry. I've mentioned in previous reviews that he is one of my favorite praise and worship leaders. This man is gifted, anointed and sings many spontanious praise and worship songs. Although there are no spontanious songs on this one, his CDs from his independent labels are loaded with them. He has a talent for ushering believers into God's presence.The songs are a mixture of upbeat and mellow classics. This is a must have. This CD is out of print and if you can get your hands on one - do it quickly!"
13,"Dense with knowledge: This film is filled with informative interviews which is great. This film is also subtitled. Not so great. Definately worth an afternoon. Watch this film with intention because it is filled with teachings, visual cues and subtitles."
14,Habe die im November gekauft.mein Mann hat eines 2mal angehabt und ist bei den √Ñrmeln schon gerissen.Ich habe es auch nur auf 30grad gewaschen.Find ich jetzt f√ºr Boss nicht sehr gut.
15,"Erst einmal sind die Shirts etwas klein ausgefallen, aber damit k√∂nnte ich leben, w√ºrde aber beim n√§chsten mal eine Nummer gr√∂√üer w√§hlen. Leider ist mir erst nach dem Waschen aufgefallen, dass sie viele kleine wei√üe Punkte haben, wie Watte oder Fussel. Habe ewig diese wei√üen Stellen mit den Fingern√§geln und einer Pinzette rausgezogen. An manchen Stellen funktioniert es, an anderen wiederum nicht so gut. Wirklich vollst√§ndig bekommt man sie nicht alle raus und keine Ahnung, ob sich nach dem Waschen wieder neue bilden oder eher mit der Zeit von alleine rausgewaschen werden. Habe so etwas noch nie erlebt. Wenn man sie nur als Unterhemden tr√§gt vielleicht okay, aber als T-Shirt geht das gar nicht."
16,"So einen guten Hammer hatte ich noch nie. Liegt gut in der Hand, gut verarbeitet, das Gewicht ist nicht zu leicht und auch nicht zu schwer. Ich kann sehr gut mit arbeiten."
17,"Bon rapport qualit√© prix, article un peu top long pour moi"
18,Son enormes. Mucho m√°s que cualquier otra marca. Se ve que las tallas son americanas y su ropa normalmente es m√°s ancha que la Europea. Tramitada devoluci√≥n con reemplazo por una talla menos
19,"La taille correspond et il est plut√¥t de bonne qualit√©. M√™me apr√®s plusieurs utilisations, lavages il ne se d√©forme pas."
20,Impeccable AAA+++üëå Une personne a trouv√© cela utile
